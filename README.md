# Signing into GitHub using SSH

You know that there are 3 ways to sign into GitHub from your local machine

- Using HTTPS
  This method requires you to have a personal access token, which comes in two ways: either
- fine-grained personal access token (Recommended)
- personal access token (classic)

- Using SSH

- Using GitHub CLI
